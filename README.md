# Power Simulation for the simple and mediation APIM

R code is presented that allows the determination of powwer and the sample size required for the simple and mediation Actor-Partner Interdependence Model (APIM) using Power Simulation Techniques. The power simulation is based on the correlations among the variables and allows the specification of skewness and kurtosis and the incorporation of missing data. For the mediation APIM, power is estimated for the direct effects, the indirect effects, and the total effects.
